# Configuration for resuming PPO training from a checkpoint
# This is an example configuration that shows how to resume training

# task name, determines output directory path
task_name: "resume_train_transformer_combined"

# Override trainer settings for resuming
trainer:
  entropy_coef: 0.0001
  optim:
    max_lr: 1e-5
  # Path to checkpoint to resume from (set this to your checkpoint file)
  resume_from_checkpoint: ${paths.models_dir}/current_best.pt  # e.g., "/path/to/checkpoint_100.pt" or "final_model.pt"
  
  # Resume mode:
  # - true: extend training by total_timesteps beyond the checkpoint
  # - false: train until total_timesteps total (may finish early if already reached)
  resume_extend_steps: true
  
  # Training configuration (can be modified for resumed training)
  total_timesteps: 5000000000  # Will be added to existing timesteps if resume_extend_steps=true

# Note: When resuming, the model architecture must match the checkpoint
# Make sure model config matches the original training configuration
